# Arduino based remote with telemetry for VESC with nRF24

As the origial project was discontinued, and having worked with the code a bit i decided i would do some cleanup.
The intention is to, hopefully, save my self and others some headaches in the future when modding the code.

To do this i have re-arranged file, and optimized code for readabillity.

Please post a issue if you have questions, requests or suggestions.
